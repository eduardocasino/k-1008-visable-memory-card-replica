# K-1008 Visable Memory card replica

## Introduction

Welcome to my K-1008 Visable Memory card replica repository. This is a work in progress, please check out from time to time.

Board is now complete and sent for fabrication.

## About

This aims to be a faithful replica of the K-1008 Visable Memory card, a memory expansion and display board for the KIM-1 designed by MTU in the late 70's

I'm using the original K-1008 documentation from various sources on the net, as well as hi-res photos form [Hans Otten's Retro Computing website](http://retro.hansotten.nl/6502-sbc/kim-1-manuals-and-software/kim-1-related-hardware/mtu-k-1012-k-1008/).
